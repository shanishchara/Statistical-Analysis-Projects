this project on ANOVA aims to determine if there are differences in measurements of a biological specimen by 
a factor variable with five break through groups.

Conducted exploratory data analysis and visual check on data to gain basic understanding of the data
prepared the data for ANOVA

The TukeyHSD function provided very specific results. We can observed the detail outcomes
on where there are statistically significant differences for M1 measurements
by F2b categories.

Crosschecked the model assumptions to validate the ANOVA results
