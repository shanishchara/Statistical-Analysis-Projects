>> The aim of this project is to predict the probability of occuring heart disease in a patient using Logistic Regresion:

>>Cleaveland clinic heart disease data were used for the project
>>Consucted exploratory data analysis and data cleaning - tidyverse, ggplot2, broom libraries were used

>>identified important clinical variables using t-test and chi squared test

>>trained logistic regression model and calculated odds ration and 95% CI
>> Assessed model performace using AUC and confusion matrix: test prediction accuracy: 93%
